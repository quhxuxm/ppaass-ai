# Compression mode for data transfer: none, zstd, lz4, gzip
# - none: No compression (default)
# - zstd: Zstandard compression - good balance of speed and ratio
# - lz4: LZ4 compression - fastest, lower compression ratio
# - gzip: Gzip compression - widely compatible, slower

# Forward Mode Configuration
# --------------------------
# If enabled, this proxy will forward all traffic to another PPAASS proxy
# instead of connecting directly to the target.
